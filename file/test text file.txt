          - OOPlugin thoughts
            - BDtemplate
              - The plugin should handle setting the object instance variables.
              - Instance variables are displayed to the user on the front panel
              - instance variables and object are kept in sync using the states "Refresh UI" and "refresh object"
              - The object should hold all state information about itself, so that the top level GUI can be launched and completely restored to a valid state using data in the object. 
              - The plugin shares some functionality with the architecture:
                - command parsing
                - status display
              - Instance variables can be set using:
                - front panel controls
                - command line (pluginname set somevariable=somedata)
                - loaded from object saved in a file
              - data transport
                - still to be developed:
                - sending data to an improved data logger
                - sending data to another plugin/object
                - grabbing data from excel (this may need to be imlpemented on the architecture scale to encompass mutliple plugins). It will likely be a script generator type plugin. Excel data -> script

              - Here's something simple, but useful to check.  With the ALC active, and the battery voltage below the threshold, and the audio being muted by the ALC .... Could you disable the ALC via the I2C and see if any clicks or pops are created?  Not sure if ALC or VOL should control the ramp.  But definitely no clicks or pops. -Tim S.

            - 3 loop structure
            - top loop: user interface
            - middle loop: 'test executive'
              - name is too fancy
              - just sequences plugins
              - also has placeholder methods for error handling, pause, resume, etc. (trying to control the sequence execution, but I think this might be better done in the bottom loop)
            - bottom loop: consumer loop
              - executes plugins
        - sunday
          - feedback for Miles
            - how commands are parsed and where they go is confusing
              - example: LoadPlugin command
                - there are two case structures with the loadplugin command nested. One in loop2 and another inside the plugin executive. This kind of duplication should be eliminated.
                - other commands that do this:
                  - most plugin executive commands
            - the single un-initalized shift register of one object should be removed from loops 2 and 3
            - what is the difference between RunVI and RunAsync commands. looks like some duplication
            - why doesn't everything have a run method? I'm seeing too much fragmentation. We need a better root class
            - root class could have an 'execution loop' data member to indicate what loop it should be run in. Loops could be exactly the same with different instances (like making the loops objects). Then objects can be assigned to run in specific loops. For the most part this will be already set by the default value of the parent class.
            - can the front panel template be simplified? We should have all that support code somewhere else. The object should be passed thru the terminals, invoking the plugin executive inside the front panel is a bad idea. It makes it really easy for someone to screw with the plugin executive.
            - Is there a way to autogenerate a blank plugin child class from a template?
            - When saving a plugin, the plugin should be able to send a return message to the status display
              - in the root class add a 'return value' string, then send this to update status display VI

              - when opened to create new VI from template
                - open from windows shell
                - open from templates dialog
            - press ctrl when mousing over to switch pointer functions
            - when setting breakpoints there is a retain values on wires button
            - client server example is two QDMH sending data to each other's queues

        - wednesday
          - LabVIEW advanced day 2
            - VIPM has an arduino module
              - https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-15971
            - can create build specifications (source distro) to install VIs to a particular directory
              - can use to install templates like ex 4-3
            - try view -> browse relationships from block diagram
            - user events
              - fire an event in an event structure programitically
              - send data with event
              - could use to create a messaging system
              - could use to stop all running VIs (as long as they are waiting at an event structure)
            - look up brat VIs on lavag
            - when working with clones ctrl-m will bring up the original 
              - ctrl-m will also lock/unlock the block diagram
              - originally, ctrl-m was a way to preview the run state
            - VI server
              - can launch multiple instances of vit (it creates a new version each time)
              - video to deal with wait until done and auto dispose
              - vishots has a video demonstrating re-entrant vs vit
              - not much difference between launching vit or reentrant (same code could work for both)
              - invoke node - close: removes from memory
              - property node - set front panel false: just closes front panel
              - VI reference node
                - strictly typed connector pane
                - could use something generic like a variant and string
                - will show front panel
                - don't need to use 
                  - run VI
                  - open front panel
                  - set control values (property node)
            - use "application directory" to return relative paths
            - active x
              - can open .xlt and it will make a new copy
              - there is an enumerator to determine file type for xlsx etc.. search for excel file type active x
            - GOOP is a by reference toolkit (~$1500). Some functionality beyond native labview OOP.
            - lavag has some hacked methods to create GOOP style by reference
            - DVR vs single element queue: cannot access DVR by name (there is no naming)
            - http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Thought-Process-Matt-Weisfeld/dp/0672330164/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1306955972&sr=8-1
            - OOP
              - DMM
                - using typedef inside object is OK
                - to get different DMM panels could use soft panels (loading child methods)
            - export data to excel or clipboard - right click on graph or array ->export
            - get all references for a class (booleans, double, etc...) - traverse for references
        - thursday
          - LabVIEW performance day 1
            - beta class. currently being updated for LV2010. 
            - test vector tool performance ideas
              - process patterns in consumer loop
              - use in place element structure for array operations
              - disable debugging
              - add benchmarking VIs (for pattern load)
              - remove repetitive use of build array
            - VI properties -> allow debugging. allows breakpoints, step in/out. Uncheck to see performance perhaps improve. Closely models performance inside .exe.
              - there are several performance improvements that only happen when debugging is disabled. See examples in course manual.
                - constant folding - optimizes blocks of code into constants.
                - dead code elimination
                - loop invariant code
                - inplaceness
            - for loops can be configured to execute in parallel in different cores
              - not always safe to do (i.e. there is a shift register)
            - do not use build array
              - if possible pre allocate an array using initalize array. If array size is unknown it is better to pre-allocate an array that is purposely too large.
              - build array and concatenate strings reallocate memory
              - for an unknown array size try using a queue to build up elements, then flush the queue to an array
        - friday
          - LabVIEW performance day 2
            - type coercion causes memory reallocation
              - a big array could have a copy made in memory when coerced
            - local varible is better than property node
              - might load front panel to memory
              - all possible properties loaded for each property node
              - requires an extra buffer allocation
              - always use a local varible before a property node for value set/get
            - input terminals set to required helps reduce memory usage because default data is not read
            - show buffer allocation tool. puts black dots on block diagram. tools - profile - show buffer allocations
            - use in place element structure
              - cleaner block diagrams for cluster unbundle/bundle and array element index/replace
              - data by reference
                - using get data value reference creates a reference to a single location in memory
                - the in place element structure is the only way to access data from a DV
            - subVI can run in place if all operations inside are inplace
            - front panel updated can be deferred while doing lots of VI server adjustments, just update when everything is done
          - summary 
            - new techniques to try
              - any array/cluster/waveform operation
                - in place element structure
              - moving data
                - local varibles
                - single element queue
                - pre allocate array, then get array subset at end. Keep count using seperate shift register.
              - add templates to template menu
                - producer consumer
                - simple state machine test sequence
                  - include template for subvi with data cluster in/out
                - FGV

          - AX54
            - matt f talk
              - switch to select 128OSR or 64OSR can also select filters, eliminating need for frequency detector
              - I2S input to FPGA does not need to support every mode, just what is from USB audio thing and 96k 32bit
              - BCLK and MCLK are both 6.144, why not tie together?
            - go ahead with stereo design

          - a nice weekend. pizza and peroni at the backspace. a town lake run with a black and white pood sighting. 2 days of monkeynest and labview. skipping the maxim picnic and loving it. the tree of life (movie).
          - I just finished working on some new labview templates. They will allow me to develop quickly. It is very important to develop templates for life. Everything that needs to be done could benefit from careful planning and preparation. If everything has been properly prepared the job goes much smoother. Taking the time to automate and organize simple tasks leave much more room to actually take care of challenges.

          - very busy at work lately. doing lots of stuff but not gettting lots done. need to focus on getting products characterized, FPGA flow, tools and code, labview architecture, refining I2C regmap and test vector tool, getting involved in the biggest and best projects, making people reliant on my software, managing the lab's data server, sharing information with everyone (such as setting up a design wiki)
          - at home. two nice trips coming up. got to get ready. the fall is coming. time to plant some veggies. saving some money is nice. I'm ready to work on the condo a bunch. running outside is about to be pleasurable again. we are bunnies in love. working on some web programming is nice. going to build a vintage skype phone. time to fire up the arduino. gots to make more time for guitar, enjoy learning a new song now and then. read some books. only way to read is have a reading lists and keep the books handy. always read at a certain time. I'd like to get the bikes out and do some epic rides. I promised dad golf at barton springs, time to look into that. I should play with him. living life to the fullest is nice.
